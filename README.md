# signals2
This is a fork of the Boost.signals 2 library (https://github.com/boostorg/signals2) with the aim to create a standalone, c++17 version of it that doesn't have any dependencies to boost or other 3rd partiy libraries (or at least as few as possible)

# disclaimer
This is mostly an experiemnt and I'm currently not planning on supporting this library in the long run, but of course you are welcome to contribute or make your own clone of this repository
